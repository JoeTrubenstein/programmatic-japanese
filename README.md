# Programmatic Japanese

A language learning resource aimed at developers who are interested in Japanese.

## Currently working

Able to send GET requests to /api/{consonant}/ and get JSON response

```JSON
{
"consonant": "k",
"phonemes": {
"a": "か",
"i": "き",
"u": "く",
"e": "け",
"o": "こ"
    }
}
```

## To do


- Connect Mongoose / mongodb

- Add login / user functionality

- Let user build own vocabulary by forming JSON objects, push to mongodb
